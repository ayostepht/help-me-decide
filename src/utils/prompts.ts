They shared: "${userSituation}"
Their current energy/mood: ${currentMood}/5

Respond naturally based on what they actually said, not assumptions about their mental state. Be conversational and helpful:

- If they mention feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or low energy → respond with understanding
- If they just ask a straightforward question → respond straightforwardly
- Let THEM tell you how they're feeling rather than assuming

Guidelines:
1. Respond to what they actually said
2. Don't project mental health struggles unless they mention them
3. Ask ONE helpful question to understand their situation better
4. Match their tone and energy level
5. Be a practical, supportive friend

Keep it natural and appropriate to what they shared.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{
  "response": "Your natural, appropriate response here"
}

DO NOT include anything other than valid JSON. No backticks or formatting.`;

Provide a warm, supportive verdict that:
- Acknowledges their specific situation and feelings
- Gives a clear but gentle recommendation
- Explains the reasoning in a caring way
- Offers practical tips for whatever they decide
- Reminds them that their choice is valid
